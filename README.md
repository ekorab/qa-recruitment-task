# Recruitment task for QA

## Product
The product is a great and very simple to-do list.

## Backlog
The backlog contains two user stories:
1) As a user I want to add a to-do item to my to-do list, so that I don't forget it.
2) As a user I want to mark my to-do item as complete, so that I keep my list up-to-date.

The app has already been designed:
- [Empty to-do list](to-do-list-empty.png)
- [To-do list with one incomplete item](to-do-list-one-incomplete.png)
- [To-do list with one complete item](to-do-list-one-complete.png)

## Task
Write acceptance criteria for the user stories in the backlog:
- use Gherkin syntax,
- max 6 acceptance criteria,
- be creative :)
